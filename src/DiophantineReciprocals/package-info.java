/** Diophantine Reciprocals

 * <p>
 * Career Cup claims that Amazon asked this as an interview question; it is also Problem 108 at Project Euler:
 * 
 * In the following equation x, y and n are positive integers: 
 *  1 / x + 1 / y = 1 / n. 
 *  For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions: 
 *  1/5 + 1/20 = 1/6 + 1/12 = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4. 
 *  What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct 
 *  solutions exceeds one thousand?
 * 
 * Your task is to solve Amazon’s question;
 * </p>
