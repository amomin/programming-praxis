/** Finding the Median

 * 
 * The median of an array is the value in the middle if the array was sorted; if 
 * the array has an odd number of items n, the median is the (n+1)/2’th 
 * largest item in the array (which is also the (n+1)/2’th smallest item in 
 * the array), and if the array has an even number of items n, the median is the arithmetic 
 * average of the n/2’th smallest item in the array and the n/2’th 
 * largest item in the array. For instance, the median of the array [2,4,5,7,3,6,1] 
 * is 4 and the median of the array [5,2,1,6,3,4] is 3.5. 
 * 
 * Your task is to write a program that takes an array of 8-bit integers (possibly but 
 * not necessarily in sort) and finds the median value in the array; you should find 
 * an algorithm that takes linear time and constant space. When you are finished, you are 
 * welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the 
 * exercise in the comments below
